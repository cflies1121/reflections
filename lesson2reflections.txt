What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

it creates the git folder which contains all the commands to manage the repository. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

the staging area allows the user to place multiple files in prior to actually committing and allows the user to actually make logical changes. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

by allowing you to update files and then check the final changes before you actually commit them.
